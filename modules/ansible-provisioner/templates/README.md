# Template for Ansible Inventory

This folder contains the template used to generate the Ansible inventory in the [inventory](../inventory/) folder. This template can be modified to any other format required by the Ansible provisioning script of your choice. The Terraform and Ansible portions have been split on purpose to keep this flexibility and this template is the only thing bridging the Ansible and Terraform configurations. See the [main README](../../../README.md) for more details about the motivation for this.
