# Ansible Inventory

This folder will be used by the Terraform configuration to generate the Ansible inventory based on the IPs of the newly provisioned VMs.

If you are just browsing through this repository and want to get a better idea of the final structure of this Ansible inventory file, refer to the [autogenerated-example-hosts.ini](./autogenerated-example-hosts.ini) file. 

If you would like to change the structure of this autogenerated file refer to [this README](../templates/README.md)
